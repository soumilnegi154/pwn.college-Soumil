# Challenge 1 Learning From Documentation

The typical need you'll have for documentation is just to figure out how to use all these dang programs, and a specific case of that is figuring out what arguments to specify on the command line.
This module will mostly dig into that concept, as a proxy for figuring out how to use the programs in general.
Through the rest of the module, you'll go through various ways of asking the environment for help for the programs, but first, we'll dig into the concept of reading documentation.

The correct usage of programs depends, in a large part, on the proper specification of arguments to them.
Recall the `-a` of `ls -a` in the `hidden files` challenge of the [Basic Commands](/linux-luminarium/commands) module: that `-a` was an _argument_ that told `ls` to list out hidden files as well as non-hidden files.
Because we _wanted_ to list out hidden files, invoking `ls` with the `-a` argument was the correct way to use it in our scenario.

The program for this challenge is `/challenge/challenge`, and you'll need to invoke it properly in order for it to give you the flag.
Let's pretend that this is its documentation:

> Welcome to the documentation for `/challenge/challenge`! To properly run this program, you will need to pass it the argument of `--giveflag`. Good luck!

Given that knowledge, go get the flag!


## Solution:

After the terminal comes up, the user needs to invoke the program `/challenge/challenge` properly by giving the arguement `--giveflag` after reading the documentation.

Thus the command is `/challenge/challenge --giveflag`.

#### Commands run:

```sh
$ /challenge/challenge --giveflag
```

## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{Amp7Z1V3GqF0XtHEIPAZ47sKp2n.QX0ITO0wyM1EzNzEzW}
```

### Notes:

- Documentation provides information about the arguments and how to properly run a program.

# Challenge 2 Learning Complex Usage

While using most commands is straightforward, the usage of some commands can get quite complex.
For example, the arguments to commands like `sed` and `awk`, which we're definitely not getting into right now, are entire programs in an esoteric programming language!
Somewhere on the spectrum between `cd` and `awk` are commands that take arguments to their arguments...

This sounds crazy, but you've already encountered this with the `find` level in [Basic Commands](/linux-luminarium/commands).
`find` has a `-name` argument, and the `-name` argument itself takes an argument specifying the name to search for.
Many other commands are analogous.

Here is this level's documentation for `/challenge/challenge`:

> Welcome to the documentation for `/challenge/challenge`! This program allows you to print arbitrary files to the terminal, when given the `--printfile` argument. The argument to the `--printfile` argument is the path of the flag to read. For example, `/challenge/challenge --printfile /challenge/DESCRIPTION.md` will print out the description of the level!

Given that documentation, go get the flag!

## Solution:

After the terminal comes up, the user needs invoke the `/challenge/challenge` program using the properly by giving the argument `--printfile` and giving that argument another argument which is the location of flag (ie `/flag`).

Thus the command is `/challenge/challenge --printfile /flag`.

#### Commands run:

```sh
$ /challenge/challenge --printfile /flag
```

## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{EdCL_CNRlPTqYCApkSXUvieshQV.QX1ITO0wyM1EzNzEzW}
```

### Notes:

- Even arguments of a program can have other arguments.
- `sed` and `awk` have very complex arguments.


# Challenge 3 Reading Manuals

This level introduces the `man` command.
`man` is short for `manual`, and will display (if available) the manual of the command you pass as an argument.
For example, let's say we wanted to learn about the `yes` command (_yes_, this is a real command):

```console
hacker@dojo:~$ man yes
```

This will display the manual page for `yes`, which will look something like this:

```text
YES(1)                           User Commands                          YES(1)

NAME
       yes - output a string repeatedly until killed

SYNOPSIS
       yes [STRING]...
       yes OPTION

DESCRIPTION
       Repeatedly output a line with all specified STRING(s), or 'y'.

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

The important sections are:

```text
NAME(1)                           CATEGORY                          NAME(1)

NAME
	This gives the name (and short description) of the command or
	concept discussed by the page.

SYNOPSIS
	This gives a short usage synopsis. These synopses have a standard
	format. Typically, each line is a different valid invocation of the
	command, and the lines can be read as:

	COMMAND [OPTIONAL_ARGUMENT] SINGLE_MANDATORY_ARGUMENT
	COMMAND [OPTIONAL_ARGUMENT] MULTIPLE_ARGUMENTS...

DESCRIPTION
	Details of the command or concept, with detailed descriptions
	of the various options.

SEE ALSO
	Other man pages or online resources that might be useful.

COLLECTION                        DATE                          NAME(1)
```

You can scroll around the manpage with your arrow keys and PgUp/PgDn.
When you're done reading the manpage, you can hit `q` to quit.

Manpages are stored in a centralized database.
If you're curious, this database lives in the `/usr/share/man` directory, but you never need to interact with it directly: you just query it using the `man` command.
The arguments to the `man` command aren't file paths, but just the names of the entries themselves (e.g., you run `man yes` to look up the `yes` manpage, rather than `man /usr/bin/yes`, which would be the actual path to the `yes` program but would result in `man` displaying garbage).

The challenge in this level has a secret option that, when you use it, will cause the challenge to print the flag.
You must learn this option through the man page for `challenge`!

## Solution:

After the terminal comes up, the user needs to read the manual for `challenge` program, this can be done using the command `man challenge`, which states that 
```
 --psrfli NUM
              print the flag if NUM is 197
```

Thus the user can print the flag using the command `/challenge/challenge  --psrfli 197`.

#### Commands run:

```sh
$ man challenge
$ /challenge/challenge  --psrfli 197
```

## Flag: 

```
 pwn.college{IpEJsr1Of9li7ZgT750NWaWqbwJ.QX0EDO0wyM1EzNzEzW}
```

### Notes:

- manuals can be read for programs using `man <program>`, argument to `man` is just the name of program.
- manuals are stored in `/usr/share/man`.


# Challenge 4 Searching Manuals

You can scroll man pages with the arrow keys (and PgUp/PgDn) and search with `/`.
After searching, you can hit `n` to go to the next result and `N` to go to the previous result.
Instead of `/`, you can use `?` to search backwards!

Find the option that will give you the flag by reading the `challenge` man page.

## Solution:

After the terminal comes up, the user needs to read the manual of `challenge` program using the command `man challenge`, then the user needs to search in the manual about which argument prints the flag (can be done using `/flag`), one of the results to the search states that 

```
 --ljsoptv
              This argument will give you the flag!
```

Thus the user can get the flag using the command `/challenge/challenge  --ljsoptv`.

#### Commands run:

```sh
$ man challenge
$ /challenge/challenge  --ljsoptv
```

## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{caLA9RnOhq0aLPRsB0gb1mXhNHY.QX1EDO0wyM1EzNzEzW}
```

### Notes:

- Manuals can be searched by using `/<search query>`.
-  You can hit `n` to go to the next result and `N` to go to the previous result. Instead of `/`, you can use `?` to search backwards.


# Challenge 5 Searching For Manuals

This level is tricky: it hides the manpage for the challenge by randomizing its name.
Luckily, all of the manpages are gathered in a searchable database, so you'll be able to search the man page database to find the hidden challenge man page!
To figure out how to search for the right manpage, read the `man` page manpage by doing: `man man`!

---
**HINT 1:** `man man` teaches you advanced usage of the `man` command itself, and you must use this knowledge to figure out how to search for the hidden manpage that will tell you how to use `/challenge/challenge`

**HINT 2:** though the manpage is randomly named, you still actually use `/challenge/challenge` to get the flag!

## Solution:

After the terminal comes up, the user needs to read the manual of `challenge` but since the name is hidden, the user needs to read the manual of `manual` using the command `man man`, which gives

```
  man -k printf
           Search the short descriptions and manual page names for the keyword printf as regular  expression.   Print
           out any matches.  Equivalent to apropos printf.
```

Thus the user can search for the manual of `challenge` using the command `man -k challenge` which gives
```
wxcxcccjew (1)       - print the flag!
```

The user can now access the manual of `challenge` using the command `man wxcxcccjew`, which gives 
```
 --wxcxcc NUM
              print the flag if NUM is 505
```

Thus the user can get the flag using the command `/challenge/challenge --wxcxcc 505`.

#### Commands run:

```sh
$ man man
$ man -k challenge
$ man wxcxcccjew
$ /challenge/challenge --wxcxcc 505
```

## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{U5LPBwx0ERcxc-ZCccZjTS-A5eY.QX2EDO0wyM1EzNzEzW}
```

### Notes:

- `man` has many arguments which can be read about in its manual using the command `man man`.


# Challenge 6 Helpful Programs

Some programs don't have a man page, but might tell you how to run them if invoked with a special argument.
Usually, this argument is `--help`, but it can often be `-h` or, in rare cases, `-?`, `help`, or other esoteric values like `/?` (though that latter is more frequently encountered on Windows).

In this level, you will practice reading a program's documentation with `--help`.
Try it out!

## Solution:

After the terminal comes up, the user needs to invoke `/challenge/challenge` with the `--help` argument, this can be done using the command `/challenge/challenge --help` which shows
```
usage: a challenge to make you ask for help [-h] [--fortune] [-v] [-g GIVE_THE_FLAG] [-p]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --fortune             read your fortune
  -v, --version         get the version number
  -g GIVE_THE_FLAG, --give-the-flag GIVE_THE_FLAG
                        get the flag, if given the correct value
  -p, --print-value     print the value that will cause the -g option to give you the flag
```

Thus the user first needs to get the correct value using `-p` argument, and then use it with the `-g` argument to get the flag. This can be done using the command `/challenge/challenge -p` `/challenge/challenge -g 492`.

#### Commands run:

```sh
$ /challenge/challenge --help
$ /challenge/challenge -p
$ /challenge/challenge -g 492
```

## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{YRjp4-Mygf92896hC3zOM68rcs8.QX3IDO0wyM1EzNzEzW}
```

### Notes:

- Most programs also have a `--help` argument which can be used to get information about its usage.


# Challenge 7 Help for Builtins

Some commands, rather than being programs with man pages and help options, are built into the shell itself.
These are called *builtins*.
Builtins are invoked just like commands, but the shell handles them internally instead of launching other programs.
You can get a list of shell builtins by running the *builtin* `help`, as so:

```console
hacker@dojo:~$ help
```

You can get help on a specific one by passing it to the `help` builtin.
Let's look at a builtin that we've already used earlier, `cd`!

```console
hacker@dojo:~$ help cd
cd: cd [-L|[-P [-e]] [-@]] [dir]
    Change the shell working directory.
    
    Change the current directory to DIR.  The default DIR is the value of the
    HOME shell variable.
...
```

Some good information!
In this challenge, we'll practice using `help` to look up help for builtins.
This challenge's `challenge` command is a shell builtin, rather than a program.
Like before, you need to lookup its help to figure out the secret value to pass to it!

## Solution:

After the terminal comes up, the user needs to read the help page of the builtin function `challenge` using the command `help challenge`, this shows
```
challenge: challenge [--fortune] [--version] [--secret SECRET]
    This builtin command will read you the flag, given the right arguments!

    Options:
      --fortune         display a fortune
      --version         display the version
      --secret VALUE    prints the flag, if VALUE is correct

    You must be sure to provide the right value to --secret. That value
    is "QnqJjkVB".
```

Thus the user can get the flag using the command `challenge --secret QnqJjkVB`.

#### Commands run:

```sh
$ help challenge
$ challenge --secret QnqJjkVB
```

## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{QnqJjkVB6jvd6cNagM1YaLvMMS5.QX0ETO0wyM1EzNzEzW}
```

### Notes:

- Builtins are invoked just like commands, but the shell handles them internally instead of launching other programs.
- You can get help on a specific command using `help <command name>`.
